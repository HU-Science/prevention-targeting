Count by county is count of heroin incidents/seizures (Opioid and Fentanly counts NOT INCLUDED)

Quantity of heroin is measured in Kilograms(Kg) of heroin. Quantity is the TOTAL amount of heroin Kg seized that quarter.

Raw data set and data dictionary for PA Opioid seizures and arrests:
https://data.pa.gov/Opioid-Related/Opioid-Seizures-and-Arrests-Year-2013-June-2018-Co/wmgc-6qvd

Note that incidents =/= arrests. Incident count is:
The number of PSP (PA State Police) seizure incidents associated with the reported drug. Incidents may include undercover buys, search warrants, traffic stops and other investigative encounters

The "Arrests" column associates the arrest count assoicated with that specific drug in that specific quarter. Note:
Arrests column is "The number of arrests, both felony and misdemeanor, in connection with the seizure of the reported drug."

Goal will be to associate avg. seizure amount and count of incidents by quarter to the number of arrests that quarter
