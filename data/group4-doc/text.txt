Count by county is count of heroin incidents/seizures (Opioid and Fentanly counts NOT INCLUDED)

Quantity of heroin is measured in Kilograms(Kg) of heroin. Quantity is the TOTAL amount of heroin Kg seized that quarter.

Raw data set and data dictionary for PA Opioid seizures and arrests:
https://data.pa.gov/Opioid-Related/Opioid-Seizures-and-Arrests-Year-2013-June-2018-Co/wmgc-6qvd

Note that incidents =/= arrests. Incident count is:
The number of PSP (PA State Police) seizure incidents associated with the reported drug. Incidents may include undercover buys, search warrants, traffic stops and other investigative encounters

The "Arrests" column associates the arrest count assoicated with that specific drug in that specific quarter. Note:
Arrests column is "The number of arrests, both felony and misdemeanor, in connection with the seizure of the reported drug."

Goal will be to associate seizure amounts and count of incidents by quarter with the number of arrests per quarter
(Note: Incidents have recorded heroin amounts too - not just arrests)
